# [i3 wm] Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text 2/3

## Installation

### With Package Control

If you have Package Control package installed, you can install i3wm-sublime from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select “Package Control: Install Package”, then search for i3wm.

### Without Package Control

If you want to edit/improve the i3wm-sublime package, this is how you should install it—otherwise, Package Control may overwrite your changes.

Clone this repository into your Packages folder:

git clone git://github.com/skk/i3wm-sublime.git 'i3wm-sublime'

## File Types Supported

* i3 wm's config file

## Features

Currently, the package only implements basic syntax highlighting for i3wm's config file. Pull requests are welcome!
Next on my list is adding support for i3wm's status bar config file.
